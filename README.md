You will need to install these tools in order to complete this workshop:

- [Pulumi Account](https://app.pulumi.com/signup) - this optional, but convenient to handle the state of the different
  stacks.
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Exoscle CLI](https://community.exoscale.com/documentation/tools/exoscale-command-line-interface/)

There is also a [devcontainer.json](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) file in this repository which you can use to spin
up a `devcontainer` with all the tools installed. Highly recommended if you are
using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview)
or
[DevPods](https://devpod.sh).
